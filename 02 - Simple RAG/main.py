MAIN.PY - RAG Chatbot Application

What it does:
- Creates a web-based chatbot that can answer questions using your indexed documents
- Implements RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) by finding relevant context before responding
- Maintains conversation history and streams responses in real-time

How it works:
1. When user asks a question:
   - Converts the question into an embedding using Gemini
   - Searches Pinecone for the 3 most similar documents
   - Combines the retrieved text as context
2. Builds a conversation with:
   - System message including the retrieved context
   - Previous conversation history
   - Current user question
3. Sends everything to OpenAI for a streaming response
4. Returns the AI's answer based on both the context and its general knowledge

Since our source files are small, each document is indexed as a complete unit without chunking.
The result is a chatbot that can answer questions about your specific documents
while still being able to have general conversations.

🎯 Operating System Interactive MCQ Quiz

👉 I’ll give you 1 question at a time.
👉 You respond with your option letter (A, B, C, or D).
👉 When you want to stop, simply reply:
STOP

At the end, I’ll calculate:
✔️ Number of correct answers
❌ Number of wrong answers
🔢 Your total score

❓ First, tell me in which Unit (I, II, III, IV, or V) you want to attempt MCQ questions.

(Example: Unit I)

👉 Once the user selects the Unit, start giving MCQ questions one by one from that Unit.
👉 After each user answer, respond with:

✅ “Correct!” if the answer is correct

❌ “Incorrect. The correct answer is (correct option and explanation).” if wrong

👉 Then proceed to the next question.

👉 If the user types STOP, show:
🎯 Quiz Stopped
✔️ Total Questions Attempted: [X]
✅ Correct Answers: [Y]
❌ Wrong Answers: [Z]

⚡ Example flow:

Bot: In which Unit do you want MCQs? (I, II, III, IV, V)

User: Unit III

Bot: First Question…

User: A

Bot: ✅ Correct!

Next Question…

…

User: STOP

Bot: 🎯 Quiz Stopped… your score summary

When the user asks for "FAQ" or anything related to "frequently asked questions," always return the complete FAQ section exactly as it is defined in the context, keeping the same structure, formatting, and style. Do not shorten, rephrase, or add extra explanations—just display the FAQ questions and answers in the predefined format.improve it readibilty by the adding lines after each question answer with proper spacing
